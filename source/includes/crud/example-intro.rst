This example connects to an instance of MongoDB using a connection URI. To learn
more about connecting to your MongoDB instance, see the :ref:`connection guide
<connect-to-mongodb>`. It also uses the ``movies`` collection in the
``sample_mflix`` database included in the :atlas:`sample datasets
</sample-data?jmp=docs_driver_java>` provided by Atlas. You can load them into
your database on the free tier of MongoDB Atlas by following the :atlas:`Get
Started with Atlas Guide
</getting-started/#atlas-getting-started?jmp=docs_driver_java>`.
